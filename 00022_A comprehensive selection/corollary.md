Excellent! :clap:

You can also combine the ideas of filtering and mapping in a single list comprehension. For example, if we need to double the numbers that are greater than 5, we could write as follows:

``` python
def double_of_greater_than_5(numbers)
  return [number * 2 for number in numbers if number > 5]
```

To sum up, the general syntax for list comprehensions is `[expression for element in list if condition]`. :sunglasses:
