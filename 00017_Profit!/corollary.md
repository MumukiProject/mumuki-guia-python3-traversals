Excellent! :star_struck:

In this case, since we wanted to obtain a sum, our variable had to be initialized to 0 since it is the neutral value of addition. If, for example, we wanted to perform a product operation (similar to sum, but multiplying) we should initialize our variable to 1. It is not always easy to determine the appropriate initial value, but it is very important to consider it starting the `for.. .in`. :hugging:
