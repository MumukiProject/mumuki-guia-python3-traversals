Do you know how many months have 28 days? :thinking:

All of them! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

Out of the bad joke, some months are longer than others, that's why we want to know from a list of balances, which ones correspond to long months - those that have 31 days. Let's look at an example:


``` python
ムfirst_quarter_balances = [
	{ "month": "January", "profit": 2 },
	{ "month": "February", "profit": 10 },
	{ "month": "March", "profit": -20 }
]

ムlong_month_balances(first_quarter_balances)
[{ "month": "January", "profit": 2 }, { "month": "March", "profit": -20 }]
```

> Define the function `long_month_balances` which works as shown above. You can use `for...in` or list comprehensions. In any case the `in` operator will be helpful.
